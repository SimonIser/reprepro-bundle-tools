reprepro-bundle-tools (0.0.1+lhm6) walhalla; urgency=medium

  * fixed debian build
  * bundle: added new switch 'bundle ls -w â€¦' to do some active waiting for server-changes
  * bundle: improved 'bundle ls -w' behaviour if bundle is not yet configured
  * test: example target repo now also contains sources
  * renamed missleading 'reference_updates.skel' to better name 'bundle-base_updates.skel'
  * draft for a new debian package apt-add-bundle
  * added bundle-repos config for the lhm backbone
  * bundle: another more sanity check - deny seal if sources_control.list is not fully applied to the bundle's reprepro-repository
  * bundle: fixed invalid source_control.list creation bug in 'bundle apply' by rescanning the bundle's ownSuite after 'reprepro export'
  * ng-bundle-compose: styling improvements on the managed-bundle-card
    - hovering feels less "wild" now
    - bundle title spans over complete card width
    - klick on ticket-link doesn't navigate to the bundle
  * added .angulardoc.json to gitignore
  * fixed: removing a package did not delete binaries because of empty FilterList-Rule

reprepro-bundle-tools (0.0.1+lhm4) walhalla; urgency=medium

  * wrong eupl version in a source file
  * backend: first draft for /apt/requiredAuth
  * backend: implementation of /api/storeCredentials
  * backend: implemented credential passing/handling in /api/updateBundles
  * added encrypted credential transmission between frontend and backend.
    NOTE: this encryption doesn't protect the transmission itself,
    it is aimed to protect the credential in the storage - which means
    that neither frontend nor backend remember all required parts to
    restore the secret for a long time.
  * added dependencies needed to build shared module for ng-bundle
