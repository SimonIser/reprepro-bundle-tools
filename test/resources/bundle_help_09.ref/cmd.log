usage: bundle list [-h] [--wait] [--own-suite OWN_SUITE] bundleName

Subcommand list: List the content - the packages - of a bundle.

positional arguments:
  bundleName            The bundleName is a value in the format
                        <distribution>[/<bundleID>] that points to the path in
                        the folder repo/bundle/ in which the bundle is stored.
                        Is is possible to just provide the <distribution>
                        part. In this case, there will be a new bundle (with a
                        newly incremented bundleID) created for this
                        distribution. To support command line completion, it
                        is also allowed to specify the full path relative to
                        the projects root in the form
                        repo/bundle/<distribution>[/<bundleID>].

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --wait, -w            print the list and actively wait (retrying the command
                        again in the background) until the list output
                        changes. Then print the new list and exit
  --own-suite OWN_SUITE
                        Suite-Selectors that defines the own suite (the suite
                        of this bundle). The default value is
                        'bundle:{bundle}'.
